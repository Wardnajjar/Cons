# PowerEye Backend

**Home Energy Monitoring System (HEMS)** is a system that collects energy data from various household appliances, processes and analyzes them, and presents the findings to users to give them insights about their energy consumption for better energy sustainability.

## Servers:

- **Web Server:** This server hosts the user interface, handles HTTP requests through RESTful APIs, manages user authentication, and facilitates user interactions.
- **Tracker Server:** The backbone of the system, centralizing backend operations, processing device data, and providing valuable insights to enhance user engagement.

## How to Run It:

1. Download packages or libraries needed by running (**pip install -r requirements.txt**)
2. Run the server using (**flask run**)

## Important Note:
- It's preferable to use virtual environment to avoid any conflicts.
